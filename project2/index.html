	<h3>Thinking Like a Programmer ...</h3>
		<p>There are five key ways to think like a programmer:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Procedural Thinking</b> which involves creating simple instructions for a computer to follow.</li>
				<li><b>Abstract Thinking</b> which involves finding commonalities among different things.</li>
				<li><b>Systems Thinking</b> which may sound intimidating, but this involves breaking down a large problem into smaller tasks.</li>
				<li><b>Technological Empathy</b> involves being able to understand a computer's actions.</li>
				<li><b>Debugging</b> which allows programmers to fix problems.</li>
			</ul>

	<h3>The WEB</h3>
		<p>There are many sites that are placed on the W E B that are made up of HTML documents. <b>HTML</b> stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. This allows the web to interpret these documents.<b>What is HTTP <em>(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</em>?</b> Well, this title is a protocol to allow the HTML pages and servers to interact with one another.</p>


	<h3>More about HTML</h3>
		<p>HTML allows a web browser to show content based on tags that are indicated through code. See some examples below.</p>
			<ul>
				<li> tag makes text <b>bold</b></li>
				<li>The "em" tag makes text <em>italicized</em></li>
			</ul>


	<h3>Attributes</h3>
		<p>Attributes allow the browser to digest additional information in a tag of an element. The structure of an attribute includes the following, "tag attr=value."Let's check out some examples below.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The "a href" attribute makes a <a href="http://pleasereboot.ca/post/21459639550/the-humble-origins-of-the-HTML-blink-tag">link</a></li>
				<li>The "img src" attribute allows a user to see an image.</li>
			</ul>

	<br>

	<h3>Void Tags</h3>
		<p>Void tags allow a developer to define a tag without worrying about closing the tag. See a list of void tags below.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"br" is an example of break</li>
				<li>"img src" is an example of displaying an image in a web page</li>
			</ul>

	<h3>Block VS Inline</h3>
		<p>A block element literally creates a block around text and can clearly be seen when looking closely at a web page. Incline allows words to wrap to the next line. Let's view some examples below.</p>
			<h4>Inline</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>"br" or break</li>
					<li>"span" contains content but allows styles to be attached</li>
					<li>Everything is pretty much inline aside from the few elements mentioned below</li>
				</ul>
		<br>
			<h4>Block</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>"p" or the paragraph tag</li>
					<li>"div" contains content but allows for styles to be attached in block </li>
					<li>"form"</li>
				</ul>

<!-- Hello CSS -->



	<h2>CSS in a Nutshell</h2>

	<div class="CSS">

	<p>CSS allows a user to style their webpage. Jacques gave the perspective of viewing a webpage in a series of boxes which helped me internalize a layout for simple to complex design.</p>

	<h3>CSS Lingo</h3>
		<p>Style: this is lingo that is pretty vague, so here's what it can mean:
			<ul>
				<li>A HTML element</li>
				<li>A HTMLÂ attribute</li>
				<li>The look of a website</li>
				<li>Or a verb as referenced by the Udacity team</li>
			</ul>

		<p>Rule: this describes the value an attribute should have</p>
		<p>Property: whatever it is you want to modify, update or change</p>
		<p>Value: this is the best friend to an attribute</p>
		<p>Selector: this is used for elements that partner with classes or attributes</p>
		<p>Class: a group of things that can be styled in bulk</p>
		<p>ID: this is just an unique name for lone sheep, aka lone elements that don't belong</p>

	<h3>CSS Styling Methods</h3>
		<h4>Method 1</h4>
			<p>For those folks out there with minimum time, you can style quickly in the head of your HTML file. Remember this code will live in the head element of your HTML document!</p>
				

		<h4>Method 2</h4>
			<p>For those folks who are a bit more organized, you're going to want to link your CSS stylesheet to your HTML stylesheet in the head. If you follow the steps below, you should be good to go in terms of styling.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>1. Write all HTML</li>
					<li>2. Write all of your CSS in a different file labeled ".css"</li>
					<li>3. Within the head of the HTML file, add a link to the stylesheet</li>
					<li>4. Don't forget to add attributes :)</li>
				</ul>

		<h4>Method 3</h4>
			<p>For messy and disorganized people, you should probably use this method. You should probably turn back now because you are essentially going to create more work for yourself by writing DUPLICATE code. Ain't nobody got time... In this method, you would update every attribute for EVERY HTML element! Personally, I would go with Method 2!</p>
